### How to use the Path builder a test a map		
**2 Building mode**		
 1. Placing blocks and generate the map ( be sure you place the ball and the hole )		
 2. Generate a random Map		
 		
'Every time you are going to export 2 .png files and 1 .txt' **the name of each is very important**		
 		
**How to test a map with Visualizer.jar**		
 - The program needs all the three files generated from the path builder in the same directory		
 - to test the magnitude of each map, in the same path put a file called 'settings.txt' with inside a float value (not more 20)
